ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Sohan from Bangladesh.

I enjoy doing both design and development. Love learning new languages and frameworks. Love working with android studio and ofcourse, who hasn't heard about unity? In addition, I've gained a lot of knowledge about contemporary web development tools and software development architectures like MVC, etc. To expand my knowledge, I am currently concentrating on machine learning and deep learning.
